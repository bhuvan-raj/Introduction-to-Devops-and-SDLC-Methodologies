# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## 1. What Is SDLC?

**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a **structured process** used by organizations to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software applications efficiently and systematically.

**Definition:**

> SDLC is a framework that defines a series of well-defined phases to ensure high-quality software is delivered within time and cost constraints while meeting customer requirements.

SDLC helps organizations:

* Reduce project risks
* Improve software quality
* Ensure clear documentation
* Maintain consistency and predictability in development

---

## 2. Why SDLC Is Important

* Provides a **clear roadmap** for software development
* Ensures **requirement clarity** before development starts
* Improves **project management and cost estimation**
* Reduces rework and failures
* Enables quality assurance at every stage

---

## 3. Different Phases of SDLC (In-Depth)

SDLC typically consists of the following phases:

---

## Phase 1: Requirement Analysis and Planning

### Purpose:

To understand **what needs to be built** and **why**.

### Activities:

* Gather requirements from stakeholders, clients, and end users
* Conduct feasibility studies (technical, financial, operational)
* Define project scope and objectives
* Identify risks and constraints

### Outputs:

* **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**
* Project plan and timelines
* Cost and resource estimation

### Key Stakeholders:

* Business analysts
* Project managers
* Clients and end users

### Importance:

Incorrect requirements lead to project failure; this phase forms the **foundation** of the entire SDLC.

---

## Phase 2: System Design

### Purpose:

To define **how the system will be built**.

### Activities:

* Create high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD)
* Define system architecture
* Database design
* UI/UX design
* Select technology stack and tools

### Design Types:

* **High-Level Design (HLD):** System architecture and components
* **Low-Level Design (LLD):** Detailed module-level design

### Outputs:

* Design documents
* Architecture diagrams
* Database schemas

### Importance:

A good design improves **scalability, security, and maintainability**.

---

## Phase 3: Implementation (Development / Coding)

### Purpose:

To convert design into **actual working software**.

### Activities:

* Write code based on design documents
* Follow coding standards and best practices
* Perform unit testing by developers
* Version control using tools like Git

### Outputs:

* Source code
* Unit test results
* Build artifacts

### Importance:

Quality coding ensures performance, security, and easier maintenance.

---

## Phase 4: Testing

### Purpose:

To ensure the software works as expected and is **defect-free**.

### Activities:

* Create test cases and test plans
* Perform different types of testing

### Types of Testing:

* Unit Testing
* Integration Testing
* System Testing
* User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
* Performance Testing
* Security Testing

### Outputs:

* Test reports
* Bug/defect logs
* Test summary reports

### Importance:

Testing prevents faulty software from reaching production.

---

## Phase 5: Deployment

### Purpose:

To release the software into the **production environment**.

### Activities:

* Configure production infrastructure
* Deploy application
* Perform smoke testing
* Train users and provide documentation

### Deployment Strategies:

* Blue-Green Deployment
* Rolling Deployment
* Canary Deployment
* Big-Bang Deployment

### Outputs:

* Live application
* Deployment documentation

### Importance:

A smooth deployment minimizes downtime and business impact.

---

## Phase 6: Maintenance and Support

### Purpose:

To keep the software **stable, secure, and up-to-date**.

### Activities:

* Fix bugs and issues
* Release updates and patches
* Improve performance
* Add new features
* Monitor system health

### Types of Maintenance:

* Corrective (bug fixes)
* Adaptive (environment changes)
* Perfective (feature improvements)
* Preventive (security updates)

### Importance:

Most software cost is incurred during maintenance; this phase ensures long-term success.

## 4. Common SDLC Models

| Model     | Description                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Waterfall | Sequential and rigid                |
| Agile     | Iterative and flexible              |
| Spiral    | Risk-driven                         |
| V-Model   | Testing-focused                     |
| DevOps    | Continuous integration and delivery |

---

## 5. SDLC and DevOps (Modern Perspective)

Traditional SDLC phases still exist in DevOps, but they are:

* Automated
* Continuous
* Integrated

DevOps transforms SDLC into **CI/CD pipelines** with continuous feedback and monitoring.

---

## 6. Summary

* SDLC is a **systematic approach** to software development.
* Each phase has a **specific goal and output**.
* Proper implementation of SDLC improves quality, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
* Modern DevOps practices enhance SDLC by enabling automation and faster delivery.
